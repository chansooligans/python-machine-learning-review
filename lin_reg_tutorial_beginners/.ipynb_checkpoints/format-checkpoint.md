# Intro
    - What is Linear Regression?
    - Examples:
        - Inference:
            - Social Sciences
            - Caselaw
                - Discrimination
                - Antitrust
                - Voting Rights
                - Estimating Damages
        - Prediction:
            - Outlier Detection
            - Risk Assessment
    - Interactive Tools
        - Show how Linear Regression is a "line of best fit"

# Applied Example
    - Real Data
    - How to use Python sklearn to code linear regression
    - Redlining data
    - Explain outcome variable (score indicating whether loan will be approved) using income, race, gender, dti
    - How to interpret coefficients correctly
    
# Assumptions:
    - Big Three: Validity + Linearity + Independence of Errors
    - Nice to Have Two: Normality of Errors + Homoscedasticity
    - What happens when assumptions are violated?

# Applied Example # 2: Testing Assumptions
    - Gautam's baby
    - Validity
        - What is the question we're trying to answer with the linear regression?
        - External validity: will baby continue growing forever?
        - Baby won't grow forever -- so what's missing? What are omitted variables?
    - Linearity 
        - Graph might be quadratic?
        - "Linearity in the Parameters": parameter can't be nonlinear
